\section{Expectation, Co-variance and Independence [5pts + 4pts]}
\subsection{Covariance [5pts]}
Suppose $X, Y$ and $Z$ are three different random variables.
Let $X$ obey a Bernoulli Distribution. The probability distribution function is
    $$p(x)=\left\{
    \begin{array}{ c l}	
        0.6 & x = c\\
        0.4 & x = -c
    \end{array}\right.$$
where $c$ is a nonzero constant. Let $Y$ obey the Standard Normal (Gaussian) Distribution, which can be written as $Y \sim N(0,1)$. $X$ and $Y$ are independent. Meanwhile, let $Z = XY$. \\
\\
\noindent Calculate the covariance of Y and Z ($Cov(Y, Z)$). Do values of c affect the covariance between Y and Z? [5pts]


\newpage
\subsection{Correlation Coefficient [4pts]}
Let X and Y be independent random variables with $var(X) = 5$ and $var(Y ) = 15$. We do
not know $E[X]$ or $E[Y]$. Let $Z = 3X + 2Y$ . What is the correlation coefficient $\rho(X,Z)=\frac{cov(X,Z)}{\sqrt{var(X)var(Z)}}$? If applicable, please round your answer to 3 decimal places. [4pts]


\newpage
\section{Optimization [15pts + 4pts Bonus for All]}
Optimization problems are related to minimizing a function (usually termed loss, cost or error function) or maximizing a function (such as the likelihood) with respect to some variable x. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions are first-order conditions for a solution in nonlinear programming to be optimal, provided that some regularity conditions are satisfied. In this question, you will be solving the following optimization problem:
\begin{align*}
    \max_{x,y} \qquad & f(x,y) = -4y + xy \\
    \text{s.t.} \qquad & g_{1}(x,y) = 2x^{2}+y^{2}\leq 12 \\
    & g_{2}(x,y) = x \leq 1
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Write the Lagrange function for the maximization problem. Now change the maximum function to a minimum function (i.e. $\underset{x,y}{min} \;\; f(x,y) = -4y + xy$) and provide the Lagrange function for the minimization problem with the same constraints $g_1$ and $g_2$.  [2pts]
        \par\textbf{Note:} The minimization problem is only for part (a).
        
    \item List the names of all of the KKT conditions and its corresponding mathematical equations or inequalities for this specific maximization problem [2pts]
    
    \item Solve for 4 possibilities formed by each constraint being active or inactive. Do not forget to check the inactive constraints for each point. Candidate points must satisfy the inactive constraints.   [5pts]
    
    \item List the candidate point(s) (there may be 0, 1, 2, or any number of candidate points)  [4pts]
    
    \item Find the \textbf{one} candidate point for which f(x,y) is largest. Check if L(x,y) is concave or convex at this point by using the \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/quadratic-approximations/a/the-hessian}{Hessian} in the \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/optimizing-multivariable-functions/a/second-partial-derivative-test}{second partial derivative test}.

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \setcounter{enumi}{5}
    \item \textbf{BONUS FOR ALL:} Make a contour plot of objective function $f(x,y)$ and constraints $g_1$ and $g_2$ using the template \href{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DZxRYuurOwEq5S1_-QeFke2lpiNxAeg4?usp=sharing}{Google Colab} code. Mark the maximum candidate point and include a screenshot of your plot. Also include the text output from the last cell in the Google Colab for grading purposes. Lastly, briefly explain why your plot makes sense in one sentence. [4pts]
        \par\textbf{Note 1:} Points on a line in the contour plot have equal values of the objective function. Keeping this in mind, you should be able to figure out the approximate location of the maximum.

\section{Maximum Likelihood [10pts + 15pts Bonus for Undergrads]}
\subsection{Discrete Example [10pts]}
Marion and Shreeya are arguing over which course they should take in Fall 2022. Marionâ€™s argument is that they should take CS-7650 NLP because Professor Roozbahani will teach it. Shreeyaâ€™s argument is that they should take CS-7641 ML because it would be difficult to take NLP without having introductory knowledge of Machine Learning.\\

\noindent To resolve this conflict, their other friend Nicole makes a proposition that they should leave it to chance to decide which course they should take. Marion then proposes that Shreeya will toss a 6-sided die 6 times, and Shreeya must get anything except 3 during the first 5 times and must get 3 during the 6th time. Any other combination will make Marion the winner. But Shreeya is also allowed to tamper with the die in any manner she likes to increase her odds.\\

\noindent Now, Shreeya needs you to help her have her way. If the probability of getting a 3 is $\theta$ and the probability of landing on 1 is double of that of landing on 2, 4, 5, and 6, what value of $\theta$ is most likely to ensure that they will have to take CS-7641 ML? Use your expertise of Maximum Likelihood Estimation and probability distribution function to convince Shreeya.\\\\\textbf{NOTE: } \textbf{You must specify the log-likelihood function and use MLE to solve this problem for full credit.} You may assume that the log-likelihood function is concave for this question \\\\

\subsection{Weibull distribution [15pts Bonus for Undergrads]}
The Weibull distribution is defined as 
$$P(X=x;\lambda,k)=\frac{k}{\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{k-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^k}\text{, }x \geq 0$$
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Assume we have one observed data $x_1$, and $X_1 \sim Weibull(\lambda)$, what is the likelihood given $ \lambda$ and k? [2 pts]

    \item Now, assume we are given $n$ such values $(x_1,...,x_n)$, $(X_1, ...,X_n)\sim Weibull(\lambda)$. Here $X_1, ...,X_n$ are i.i.d. random variables. What is the likelihood of this data given $\lambda$ and k? You may leave your answer in product form. [3 pts]

\subsection{Mutual Information and Entropy [19pts]}
A recent study has shown symptomatic infections are responsible for higher transmission rates. Using the \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186WWeuLm4IO2fSLIU-qN9-znGNZtsVQxf36L4PJQin0/edit?usp=sharing}{data} collected from positively tested patients, we wish to determine which feature(s) have the greatest impact on whether or not some will present with symptoms. To do this, we will compute the entropies, conditional entropies, and mutual information of select features. Please use base 2 when computing logarithms.
